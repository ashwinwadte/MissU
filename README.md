# MissU
This is an android app used to find missing people using face recognition api.<br>
Users can post the lost or found request in the app through their account.<br>
If the any of the lost request matches with any of the found request then both the users are notified.<br>
Three apis are used in this app, viz. firebase to store data, parse to store images and kairos to do face recognition.
